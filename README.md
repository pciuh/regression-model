# Regression Model Project

## Project Overview

In this repository, a regression model is built and validated using the data provided.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is provided in a `data.csv` file and includes multiple variables. The task is to build a regression model that explains the dependent variable using the other variables in the dataset.

## Project Tasks

1. **Model Selection and Validation**:
   - Build a regression model using the dependent variable and the other variables in the dataset.
   - Choose the model algorithm, and you can test multiple algorithms (optional).
   - Decide which variable(s) to use for splitting the data into training and validation samples.
   - Justify your chosen validation approach.

2. **Regression Results**:
   - Present the regression results using a scatter plot.
   - Use aesthetics to indicate different groups on the plot. You may need separate scatter plots for different groups (depending on the case).

## Summary

- **Approach Justification**: Description and justification of approach is presented in a [*Jupyter-Notebook*](https://github.com/pciuh/regression-model/blob/main/regression-model.ipynb) report.
- **Include Plot**: The report includes the scatter plot visualization.
